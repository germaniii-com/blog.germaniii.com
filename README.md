# blog.germaniii.com

This is a repository for the German III blog. which can be accessed at https://blog.germaniii.com.
This will also serve as a wiki for development, consolidating all my learnings throughout my career, and breaking them down into different notes.

## Technology

Initially planned was Gatsby, Tailwind and Strapi CMS.
Due to high maintenance, I have opted to use Quartz 4 since I would only have to make markdown files for the blog posts.


## Notes

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run serve`           | Run the server     |

Credits to jzhao for creating quartz and helping us make websites out of our obsidian notes easily.

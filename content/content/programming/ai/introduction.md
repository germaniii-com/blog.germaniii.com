# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

As of 2025, AI/ML has taken over the market. There are already jobs listed looking for AI/ML experts and the like.
Let's take a dive into the vast and mystical world of AI/ML, and find out if it really is magic, or just another gimmick.

## What it's about

Let's start with Artificial Intelligence (AI). So basically, AI is a broad field of technologies aiming to mimic the human mind.
Think of it like in my case, Information Technology has a lot of branches, Software, Hardware, Networks, Security, etc.
In the case of AI, it branches off (as of 2025) to a few subsets namely:

- [[Machine Learning]]
- [[Deep Learning]]
- [[Natural Language Processing]]
- [[Robotics]]
- [[Expert Systems]]
- [[Speech Recognition]]

### Advanced topics
Due to the advance of AI technologies, there are more applications and use-cases available. Here are a few:

- [[RAG]]
- [[Fine Tuning]]
- [[Prompt Engineering]]
- [[Quantization]]

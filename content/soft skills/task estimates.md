In my time at Bluewind Asia, there is one point where my boss taught me one thing about time management.

Things to consider when making estimates:
* Make a document for your self to log out all the tasks that you need.
	* List out descriptions and number of hours to fulfill each task.
	* Add a buffer to the tasks, +15% extra for detail design, basic design and buffer, +45% for UAT and bugs,

| Task Name | Description | Estimated Hours | Basic Design | Detail Design | Bug fixing | Buffer |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| foo       | barbaz      | x               | 15%          | 15%           | 45%        | 15%    |

Based on the table above, to get the total number of hours roughly, that you can give to the client, you can use the formula:

> x + 15% + 15% + 45% + 15%
